### Explanation of Key Points

- **Semantic HTML**: The use of `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc., for proper content structure.
- **CSS Flexbox and Grid**: Used for laying out the navigation, main content, and footer sections. Media queries ensure the layout is responsive on smaller screens.
- **Pseudo-classes**: Used `:hover` for interactive effects on navigation links.
- **Box Model**: Applied proper spacing using padding and margin for better readability and layout.
- **Transitions and Animations**: Added smooth scrolling for navigation links and hover effects.
- **Accessibility**: Implemented ARIA attributes and semantic elements for better accessibility.
- **Documentation**: Provided a README file with project objectives, features, and instructions for running the website locally.
